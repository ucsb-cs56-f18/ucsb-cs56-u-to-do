This project is a to-do list web-app that allows the user to create a list of things they need to accomplish giving them a way to organize their schedule

URL to main webapp: https://ucsb-cs56-u-to-do.herokuapp.com



Link to Running Version of Side Project #1 (Firebase login issue): https://utodo2.herokuapp.com/index.html.
To test the side project enter an email (doesn't have to be a valid email just the proper format) as the user name, enter a password, and select "sign up". A "sign out" button will appear indicating that you are signed in and have access to the database.


This repo contains the code for a to-do list that is implemented using a java ArrayList. A ToDoList object allows the user to create a list of to-dos that consist of a due date, an urgency, and text explaining the to-do. The ToDoList is kept in sorted order and the user has the ability to choose between sorting by due date or by urgency dynamically at run time.

This code was originally going to be used as part of the main ucsb-cs56-u-to-do project but the group dedided on another solution for handling the to-do list and sorting. As a result this code has been turned into a side project.

To test this code fork this repo and from the top of the directory type the following lines into the console window: "javac ToDoListTest.java" and "java ToDoList".
